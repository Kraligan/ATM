# ATM

To clone and open the project, I recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio. You can simply go to the main page of this repository and click on the green button "code<>" at the top right corner, and "Open with Visual Studio". (You can see those steps in the picture below)
Once it opens in Visual studio, put the following path: "https://github.com/Kraligan/ATM" (it should be filled automatically) and select a path on your machine. (generally "C:\Users\Username\Source\Repos\ATM").

Test cases:
Run the program
1. Set the PIN as the ATM asks, for example 1111
2. Let's try a wrong pin, it doesn't work so we have to try again
3. Let's try a correct pin, it works so we have to select the account
4. we select a wrong account 3 times so the machine kicks us out.
5. Let's start again, enter the correct pin and select the correct account
   - The machine asks which action we want to perform, let's try the three different actions.
     1. Look at the account balance
     2. Add some money on the account (the machine prints the new balance)
     3. remove some money (the machine prints the new balance)

See two pictures below about the test cases.
